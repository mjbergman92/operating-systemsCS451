This demo was run by compiling in CMake with the parameters being 'input.txt 5', where input.txt is the pid and times, and 5 is the slice number.

Scheduler: Time Now: 0 second
Scheduling to Process 0 (Pid 19590) for the time slice of 5 seconds.
Process 0: my PID is 19590: I just got started. I am starting with the
number 2868847118 to find the next prime number.

Scheduler: Time Now: 5 second
Process 0: my PID is 19590: I am about to be suspended...
No prime found yet.
Suspending Process 0 and scheduling Process 4 (Pid 19591)
for the time slice of 5 seconds.
Process 4: my PID is 19591: I just got started. I am starting with the
number 8452592327 to find the next prime number.

Scheduler: Time Now: 10 second
Process 4: my PID is 19591: I am about to be suspended...
No prime found yet.
Suspending Process 4 and scheduling Process 6 (Pid 19592)
for the time slice of 5 seconds.
Process 6: my PID is 19592: I just got started. I am starting with the
number 1120226421 to find the next prime number.

Scheduler: Time Now: 15 second
Process 6: my PID is 19592: I am about to be suspended...
Highest prime number I found is 1120226423.
Suspending Process 6 and scheduling Process 7 (Pid 19593)
for the time slice of 5 seconds.
Process 7: my PID is 19593: I just got started. I am starting with the
number 9126259892 to find the next prime number.

Scheduler: Time Now: 20 second
Suspending Process 7 and scheduling Process 0 (Pid 19590)
Process 0: my PID is 19590: I just got resumed.
Process 7: my PID is 19593: I am about to be suspended...
for the time slice of 5 seconds.
No prime found yet.

Scheduler: Time Now: 25 second
Suspending Process 0 and scheduling Process 4 (Pid 19591)
Process 0: my PID is 19590: I completed my task
